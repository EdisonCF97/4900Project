SushiLin Online Ordering Website 

Sushi Lin is a responsive website prototype for Japanese takeout and dine-in orders. Users can browse the menu, select quantities, and add to the cart; the cart remains 
consistent across all pages and calculates prices in real time. It also supports subscriptions, reservations, contact forms, and a simulated login. Emphasizing a unified design 
language and ease of use, the website is suitable for classroom demonstrations.
